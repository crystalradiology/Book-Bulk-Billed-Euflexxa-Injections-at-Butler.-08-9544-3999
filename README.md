Living with knee pain can significantly affect your daily activities, mobility, and quality of life. For many Australians with osteoarthritis, conservative treatments like physiotherapy and pain medication may no longer provide enough relief. This is where Book Euflexxa Injections at Butler becomes an effective, non-surgical option designed to reduce pain, improve joint movement, and help you return to an active lifestyle.
At Butler Medical Imaging, we offer bulk billed Euflexxa injections performed under image guidance, ensuring precision, safety, and patient comfort.
What Are Euflexxa Injections?
Euflexxa is a viscosupplement injection made from hyaluronic acid, a substance that naturally occurs in healthy joint fluid. In people with knee osteoarthritis, this fluid becomes thinner and less effective at cushioning the joint.
Euflexxa injections help by:
•	Restoring lubrication in the knee joint
•	Improving shock absorption
•	Reducing inflammation and stiffness
•	Enhancing joint mobility
Patients who Book Euflexxa Injections at Butler often experience gradual but meaningful pain relief over several weeks, with benefits lasting for months.
Who Can Benefit from Euflexxa Injections?
Euflexxa injections are commonly recommended for patients who:
•	Have mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis
•	Experience chronic knee pain or stiffness
•	Have not responded well to physiotherapy or medications
•	Want to delay or avoid knee replacement surgery
Your referring doctor may suggest this treatment if imaging shows cartilage wear but the joint is still suitable for viscosupplementation.
How Euflexxa Injections Work
Healthy knees rely on thick, elastic joint fluid to move smoothly. Osteoarthritis reduces the quality of this fluid, leading to pain and restricted movement.
When you Book Euflexxa Injections at Butler, the injection:
•	Supplements the joint with hyaluronic acid
•	Improves lubrication between joint surfaces
•	Reduces friction during movement
•	Helps protect remaining cartilage
This process does not cure osteoarthritis but can significantly improve symptoms and quality of life.
What Happens During the Procedure?
At Butler Medical Imaging, Euflexxa injections are performed by experienced radiologists using ultrasound or X-ray guidance for accuracy.
Step-by-step process:
•	You’ll be positioned comfortably on the examination table
•	The skin is cleaned thoroughly to prevent infection
•	Imaging guidance is used to locate the exact joint space
•	The Euflexxa injection is administered precisely into the knee
•	The procedure usually takes 15–20 minutes
Patients who Book Euflexxa Injections at Butler can usually walk out shortly after the procedure.
Is the Procedure Painful?
Most patients report only mild discomfort during the injection. The use of image guidance minimises pain and ensures the medication is delivered exactly where it’s needed.
•	After the procedure, you may experience:
•	Mild swelling or stiffness for 24–48 hours
•	Gradual pain relief starting within a few weeks
Normal activities can usually be resumed the same or next day, unless your doctor advises otherwise.
How Many Injections Are Needed?
Euflexxa treatment typically involves:
A series of three injections, given one week apart
Your doctor will determine the most appropriate schedule based on your condition and symptoms. Many patients who Book Euflexxa Injections  at Butler notice improvement after the full course is completed.
Are Euflexxa Injections Safe?
Yes. Euflexxa has been widely used and studied for knee osteoarthritis and is considered safe when administered by trained professionals.
Possible side effects (usually mild and temporary):
•	Localised swelling
•	Warmth around the knee
•	Mild joint pain
Serious complications are rare. At Butler Medical Imaging, strict infection control protocols are followed to ensure patient safety.
